		<h3>Share me App</h3>

		<p>This was a project I built early in 2022 so that clients can store different kinds of images. I was the sole creator/developer of this project.
		<br>
		<br>
		The aim of this app was to allow different users upload different kinds of images after they have been loggeed in using googleOauth.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to post different types of images they had regarding their various categories and then they could logout using googleLogout. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this project for over 1-2 months, making sure every functionality was intact and had no issues and also making sure it was responsive. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I had no issue with any client when building this project...
