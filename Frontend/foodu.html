		<h3>Foodu App</h3>

		<p>This was a project I built early in 2022 so that clients can order different kinds of meal. I was the sole creator/developer of this project.
		<br>
		<br>
		The aim of this app was to allow different users place in an order for the kind of food they'd want to be delivered.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to pass in their name, email, time of delivery and also date of delivery so as to know when to deliver the food. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this project for over 1 month, making sure every functionality was intact and had no issues and also making sure it was responsive. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I had no issue with any client when building this project...
